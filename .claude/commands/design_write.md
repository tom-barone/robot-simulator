In a file @.claude/docs/design.md, write up a very basic design of the system outlined in @.claude/docs/requirements.md.

You will strive for simplicity and clarity.

The layout for @.claude/docs/design.md should be:

# Design Document

Include a very brief description of the high level system architecture and design.

# Entities

- Simple list of entities that are part of the system.

Do not include any relations or attributes at this point, just the entities themselves.

# Class Diagrams

Include a list of simple class diagrams that represent the entities and their relationships. Use Mermaid syntax for the diagrams.

```mermaid
classDiagram
...
```

Only include class attributes and public methods.
